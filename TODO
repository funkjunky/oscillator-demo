# able to slide down keyboard with cursor
 - set a 'mousedown' state on App and pass it down to <Key />
 - use mouseEnter and mouseLeave, and check for mouseDown on whether to start tone or stop tone [? is there an edge case where I should not check onmouseLeave]

# Assign keys to Keyboard

# Slider and input, for frequency scale
