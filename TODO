# Add attack and release slider, like in sweep tutorial
 - maybe make a line graph that visualizes the attack an release, if so I could remove the sliders! and just label it 'envelope'

# Change the offset to "wobble"
 - At 0 there is no change. at +1, or -1, sweep from [+1 to note, or -1 to note, at an interval, perhaps a up and down slider for the duration of the slider... if not do a sweep every half a second?
 - visualize w canvas.

~ perhaps have a life visualization where we show the value with a blue dash , same with attack release. I would need to get the "current value" from the node, somehow.

 - clean up middleware

# Slider and input, for frequency octave
 - add a 'detuneDirection' member to synth, 'inc', 'dec' and 'null'

 - add a setInterval in the middleware for applying things to nodes.
 - add code in setInterval that brings 'detune' back to 0 if 'null', other inc or dec. All based on dt. delta time.
 - then apply detune to all oscillators

 - add key input for ',' and '.' for bend
 - add a UI '>###>' on each side that represents what bend value is going.
##

# Add keyboard shortcuts for all controls
 - cycle through 'type': 'q' [move through an array of all types]
 - type onChange: call 'setPeriodicWave' on all set nodes.
 - octave up 'e', octave down 'w'
 - offset up '=', offset down '-'


 - new component for 'Appreggiator' w addTo, and reset, and all a tempo slider
# Add an "sequencer" section for the new component
 - checkbox "use sequencer" with fieldset that shows options:
 - button: 'reset', tempo slider with input showing tempo [default 120]
 - on key up, add a key to the "sequence"
##

# Add multiple keyboards
 - 3 keyboards, numbered 1-3, selectable through those keys

 - how to play more than 2 notes at the same time??? properly using the API More research

# What's next???? perhaps recording notes, scale and timing, recording key strokes and time? Showing on a notes sheet and a line tracking time?

##DONE##

# Assign keys to Keyboard
# able to slide down keyboard with cursor
